                            I needed to download some movies for my international flight but didn't have nearly enough room on my laptop. UMMI made it so fast and easy to clear up space in my storage by clearing out all my my unwanted photos. I would high reccomend

                            I found out I had to use my personal computer for work but was scared I would accidentally send the explicit photos on my laptop to my boss. Thanks to UMMI I was able to create a seperate genitals folder and remove those pictures from my regualr camera roll. I love this app!

                           I used the violence detection setting to quickly filter out any violent content I had on my phone before giving it to my daughter. Now she can play games on my phone without me having to worry about her accidentally clicking soemthing. So fast and easy- thanks, UMMI!

                        I adopted my rescue dog, Riley 5 years ago today. I wanted to find the perfect picture of him to post on the gram but didn't want to sift through my thousands of photos to do it. With the tags option I just typed in "dog" and all my favorite photos of Riley came up. Got a bunch of likes and even decided to make a photo book of my best friend. UMMI, you rock!

                      I used the tags setting to post all of my favorite photos of places I've eaten whenever it feels appropiate. Last week on Natioanl Pizza day I was able to find all my photos of pizza in a matter of seconds- and the picture was a big hit! UMMI's awesome!

                  After just redownloading Grindr after taking a long break I want to find all my old shirtless pictures to send to some guys. With UMMI I didn't have to scroll through all my photos. I found all my old pics quickly and easily without much thinking. I already have a date tonight! UMMI - you're such an awesome wingman!
